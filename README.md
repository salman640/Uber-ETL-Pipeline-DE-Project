# Uber-ETL-Pipeline-DE-Project



# Uber Data Analytics | Modern Data Engineering GCP Project

## Introduction

This project implements an end-to-end data engineering pipeline for analyzing Uber-style taxi trip data using Google Cloud Platform. The objective is to transform raw trip records into structured, analytics-ready datasets and generate insights through SQL queries and dashboards.
The pipeline follows a real-world data workflow: raw data ingestion, transformation, storage, and visualization. The focus is on data reliability, scalability, and clear separation between raw and processed data, rather than experimentation or machine learning.
